My name is Yu-Sheng (Ethan) Su. I am a research scientist at AMD [GenAI team](https://zicliu.wixsite.com/mysite) (is hiring ðŸ”¥) and work on large-scale foundation models, especially focusing on pre-training/post-training framework and training efficiency optimization. Before I joined AMD, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher hosted by [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) from [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) / [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). I completed my Ph.D. in [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). Throughout my Ph.D. (from 2019 to 2023), I had the privilege of being advised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dT0v5u0AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) and being a part of the [THUNLP Lab](https://github.com/thunlp) hosted by [Maosong Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4033.htm). Besides, I worked closely with some LLM start-up teams including [ModelBest](https://github.com/OpenBMB) and [llm360](https://www.llm360.ai/).

## Hiring
AMD's GenAI team focuses on building a series of foundation models and is hiring ðŸ”¥ for multiple roles, including Principal Research Scientist, Applied Research Scientist, and Research Intern. [[Click here](https://zicliu.wixsite.com/mysite)] to know more and feel free to reach me out if youâ€™re interested in.


## Research
My primary work and research focus on advancing models toward achieving AGI. Thus, I concentrate on the following key areas: (1) scaling pre-training and post-training frameworks, (2) improving efficiency, and (3) designing inference/agent engines to facilitate the rapid iterative development of foundation models.

<!--
My research spans the areas of natural language processing and machine learning, specifically focusing on <b>large language models (LLMs)</b>. I am particularly interested in how to better pre-train, fine-tune/instruction-tune, evaluate LLMs, and advance them in real-world scenarios. Thus, my research broadly covers the following topics:

* <b> Retrieval Augmented LLM </b> Equip LLMs with the capability to leverage external retrieval information, thereby enhancing their understanding and increasing their trustworthiness. ([CokeBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13964), [CSS-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03752)) [[Talk20230723](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lKARwrVFpoTh2E7W8K7B8R6AWncKrDGw/view?usp=sharing)]

* <b>(Fine-tune/Instruction-tune) Computational Efficiency Tuning </b> Develop theories, tools, and algorithms to tune LLMs, enabling them to better understand human's instruction and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks in a computation-friendly manner. (e.g., parameter-efficient tuning methods, instruction tuning). ([Prompt Transferability](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.290/), [IPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07867), [Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06904), [APET](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3CIQIYNGlp)) [[Talk20230723](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lKARwrVFpoTh2E7W8K7B8R6AWncKrDGw/view?usp=sharing), [Talk20240307](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zo5aGkeOw16PoUYPxjW_2xllAValW_1x/view?usp=sharing)]


Recently, I am more focus on:

* <b>Autonomous Agent </b> Developing agents (based on LLMs) that can autonomously interact with the external environment (or humans) to self-improve and drive long-horizon decision-making, thereby accomplishing more complex tasks in the real world ([AgentVerse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10848), [XAgent](https://blog.x-agent.net/about/), [Tool Leaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08354), [ChatDev](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924)) <small> Note that: Currently, I am exploring ways to transform an assistant agent into an autonomous agent. </small> [[Talk20240228](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12M7O3cq8cJX7XXxUMG4IkkwuYP5s8nAh/view?usp=sharing), [Talk20240307](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zo5aGkeOw16PoUYPxjW_2xllAValW_1x/view?usp=sharing)]
